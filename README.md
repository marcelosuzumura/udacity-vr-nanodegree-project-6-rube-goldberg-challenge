# Udacity VR Nanodegree

## High Immersion Unity, Focus Path: Project Rube Goldberg Challenge

### Developed by **Marcelo Suzumura**

### For which headset?

This project was developed **only** for HTC Vive.
The build file is in the Build folder.

### How much development time?

About 30 hours.

### What I thought was interesting

It was my first game for the Vive and, to my surprise, I thought it was very intuitive to code using Steam VR.

The motion controllers add a whole new level of interactivity, leading to a fantastic level of immersion. It does not compare to Cardboard VR in any way, and it's absolutely incredible.

For this project, I thought the idea of making a playground and coding the tools for the player to use was what made it interesting to develop. So congratulations for the Udacity team for proposing such an interesting project.

### What I thought was challenging

Since I decided to use Unity 5.6.1f1, I ran into some small problems initially and had to dig some forums to make the controllers work. But it was not that hard to find info about how to correct the problem.

Overall, it was a lot of code to make it work, at least a lot more than when compared to all the previous projecs.

### Controls

There's a tutorial on the first level, but I'll list the controls here as well.

- Left touchpad

  - light touch: teleportation laser
  - press: teleport to where the laser is pointing

- Right touchpad

  - light touch: enable menu
  - press left/right: cycle through Rube Goldberg objects
  - light touch + trigger press: spawn selected Rube Goldberg object

- Both controllers:

  - trigger press: grab object
  - trigger release: release object
